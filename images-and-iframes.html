      <p><i>Cristiano Ronaldo, born in Madeira, Portugal in 1985,<br>
        rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest footballers of<br> 
        all time. Known for his speed, skill, and relentless drive, he began his<br>
         professional career with Sporting CP before making a name at<br>
         Manchester United. His legendary stint at Real Madrid saw him break<br>
          countless records and win multiple Champions League titles. <br>
         Later, he played for Juventus, returned to Manchester United, and<br> 
         currently stars for Al-Nassr. A five-time Ballon d’Or winner and Portugal’s<br>
          all-time top scorer, Ronaldo’s legacy is defined by his unmatched work ethic, <br>
           influence, and love for the beautiful game.<br>

    <img src="ronaldo1.jpg" alt="Suiiii" width="400" height="300">
  <p> The “Siuuu” celebration started around 2013 when Ronaldo played for Real Madrid. During a game in the U.S.,</p>
  <p> he shouted “Sii!” (Spanish for “Yes!”) after scoring, and fans loved it. He kept doing it,</p>
  <p>adding the spin and jump later. Since then, it’s become his signature move and a symbol of his success.</p>

    <img src="ronaldo3.jpg" alt="Ronaldo’s chop" width="400" height="300">
  <p> The Ronaldo Chop is one of Cristiano Ronaldo’s signature moves. He uses it to quickly change direction and</p>
  <p>trick defenders. To do it, he jumps slightly, swings one leg across his body, and cuts the ball behind his other</p>
  <p>leg. It’s fast, flashy, and great for beating opponents, messi is better especially when running down the wing.</p>
